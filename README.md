# 🚩 RedFlag App

RedFlag App (MVP) — an open-source relationship intelligence coach built with Kotlin + Jetpack Compose.

It helps identify 🚩 red flags and 🟢 green signals in dating by providing playbook-style conversations, OSINT toolkit integrations, and note-taking — all in one mobile app.

---

## ✨ Features (MVP)

✅ Stage-based playbook (preloaded, JSON-based) to guide conversations
✅ Simple navigation using Jetpack Compose + NavHost
✅ OSINT toolkit with reverse image search:

* Google Images
* Yandex Images
* TinEye
  ✅ Local notes & scoring to mark answers as 🚩 or 🟢

---

## 🎯 Vision

> Dating is risky — full of scammers, narcissists, escorts, and time-wasters.
> RedFlag App provides structured conversational playbooks + integrated background checks so people can spot red flags early and avoid wasting months of their life.
